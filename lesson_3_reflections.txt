git remote //lists out the remotes one has, if any
git remote -v //lists out the remotes one has in greater detail (verbose), if any
git remote add [remote name] [GitHub server URL] //creates a new remote branch at the given repository on GitHub
git push [remote name] [branch name] //pushes the local branch onto the remote branch on GitHub

Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: When I intend to share my work with other people.
