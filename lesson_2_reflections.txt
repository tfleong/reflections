git init //initializes a git repository but does not create a commit
ls -a //lists all the files in the selected directory, including hidden folders like .git
git status //checks the status of the files in the repository

Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A: A .git folder is created which stores all the metadata of said repository. This has to be done
so that the user is able to take advantage of the features of version control.
